## F.A.Q
**Q: I get a warning/error saying the file might be potentially dangerous, is it a virus?**

A: This is because i don't have a signing certificate. Why ? It cost money. A lot of money. So yeah you can safely run the app, after accepting once you shouldn't get a warning anymore. However if you don't trust the export, feel free to clone the project and open it directly into Godot.

**Q: Why ?**

A: "For the glory of Satan of course ! \**Fire in background\**"...Ahem, more seriously, i made this tool to replace the old LN converter made by Xcrypt, as is it a console app, and that is scary. Having a gui feels much better, and changing parameters is quicker.
